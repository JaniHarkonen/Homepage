  Because investing is one of my hobbies, I consume a lot of articles on the economy and 
  often find myself taking notes in order to form a view on things. To this end, I created
  <b>ArticleSum.</b> whose chief purpose is to function as a note-taking application when doing 
  market research. The app also provides different modules for visualising the notes, such as 
  a timeline view and a word cloud view.

  The basic idea is, that the user writes down information on the news articles that they've 
  read. This information can later be queried and filtered via the search bar which supports
  ehanced search features including date ranges, black-listed words, compound words etc. 
  Tags can be added to the tag inventory and assigned to the notes of the news articles to make 
  searching and grouping them easier.

  This app has been written in a way so as to allow new visualization modules to be added as 
  they are needed. A special care was put into the modularity of the architecture of <b>ArticleSum.</b>
  to make it easier to extend in the future. <b>ArticleSum.</b> was built using <b>React</b>, 
  <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>HTML</b> and runs on <b>Electron</b>.
