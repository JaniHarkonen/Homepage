# Homepage

Here's the source code for my personal website. For this project, I decided to use Angular and TypeScript even though
the site is rather minimalistic and simple in its functionality. I used these technologies mainly to get more familiar 
with them and to expand my skill set.

The website itself is hosted over at: [janiharkonen.netlify.app](https://janiharkonen.netlify.app).

### Installation

Once cloned, a simple ``npm install`` should be enough to install all the required dependencies.
No additional libraries, aside from those provided by ``ng new``, were used.

``ng serve`` to run the website served on port ``4200``.
