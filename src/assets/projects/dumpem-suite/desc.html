  <b>DumpEm Suite</b> is a collection of tools that allows me to structure and carry out my investment process.
  The app has been tailored to fit my particular approach to investment where candidate companies are 
  filtered using simple criteria first proceeding with a fundamental analysis.

<p>
  <b>DumpEm Suite</b> allows you to import stocks and assign color codes to them at each level of the process. 
  The app uses a scraper written using my custom scripting language, <b>ScrapeScript</b>, to extract data from 
  a Kaupplehti's downloaded HTML-document. Research material, such as annual and quarterly reports or press 
  releases, can be imported into the<b>DumpEm Suite</b> workspace. <b>TradingView's Advanced Real-Time Chart 
  Widget</b> is used to display a chart which allows you to use a wide variety of technical indicators to assist 
  you in your technical analysis.

  DumpEm Suite is designed to be extended with different modules and features in the future. It was built
  using <b>React</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>HTML</b> and powered by <b>Electron</b>.
