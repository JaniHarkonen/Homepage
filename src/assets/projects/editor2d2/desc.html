  This is the second iteration of my Editor2D tile-based generic level editor. The aim of <b>Editor2D2</b> was to build
  a level editor for any 2D game regardless of the game engine used. <b>Editor2D2</b> was designed to be usable as is, 
  meaning no further modifications to the code are required. However, the codebase has been written to be highly
  modular so that it can be tailored to the needs of any particular engine. Basically, <b>Editor2D2</b> can function as 
  a stand-alone level editor or as the foundation for a new one.

  Levels can be created using three types of placeables: objects, background tiles and data tiles. The graphical
  representations of these placeables can be imported to the workspace. The placeables are inserted onto layers
  where they can be manipulated (rotated, scaled, etc.) using different tools. Finished levels can be exported 
  via an independent compiler where the developer can decide the structure of the output file.

  <b>Editor2D2</b> was built using <b>Java</b>. The app uses a type of model-view-controller architecture where the 
  view is built with Java's <b>Swing</b>.
