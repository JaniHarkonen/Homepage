  When flipping items for profit in OldSchool RuneScape's it can sometimes be difficult to keep track
  of all the items that have been flipped thus far. This is one of my earlier Electron-based apps that 
  I built to aid me with the above meantioned problem.

  Basically, stickers can be created and placed into the app by assigning each sticker the name of 
  the item being flipped. The buy and sell prices of the item can be entered into the sticker 
  to quickly calculate the profit-per-unit that can be made on the trade. The GE-limit (maximum number
  of units that can be purchased every 4 hours on the Grand Exchange) can also be set.

  Each sticker also has a state associated with them to indicate the state of the trade. It can either 
  be open, completed, aborted or reset. When a trade is opened, meaning the first unit is purchased, a 
  cooldown timer will start to indicate when the GE-limit will be reset.
