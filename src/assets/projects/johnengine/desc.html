  This is the biggest, and probably the most complex, project that I've embarked on yet. JOHNEngine is my 
  first attempt at creating a 3D game engine mostly from scratch with some help from LWJGL and its OpenGL-
  bindings. The idea is to create a game engine with all the basic features that you'd expect:
  <ul>
    <li>multi-threading where each thread is running a specific system (logic, renderer, asset manager etc.)</li>
    <li>renderer that can render a UI, skeletal animations, meshes with multiple maps (diffuse, specular, normal etc.), 
      lights and shadows
    </li>
    <li>
      support for different rendering techniques (such as instanced or batch rendering) as well as other 
      graphics APIs (such as Vulkan)
    </li>
    <li>simple physics and collision detecion</li>
    <li>
      sound system
    </li>
    <li>
      networking capabilities using UDP and TCP
    </li>
  </ul>
  The game engine is designed to be highly modular, so that the different systems (namely the logic and the 
  renderer) can be completely separated from one another. This will make the implementation of game servers as 
  well as other graphics APIs easier. Throughout this project I've spent a considerable time thinking about 
  software architecture and utilizing various OOP-concepts and design patterns to create a system that supports 
  the above mentioned criteria.

  The engine uses <b>Java</b>, <b>LWJGL</b> and <b>OpenGL</b>.
